       <h1>Goa</h1><br/>
     <p>
     Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. 
     Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 
     17th-century churches and the areaâ€™s tropical spice plantations. 
     Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at 
     Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.
